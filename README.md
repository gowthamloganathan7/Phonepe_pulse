Phonepe_Pulse_Data_Visualization_and_Exploration
Problem Statement:
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner. The solution must include the following steps:

Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and clone it..
Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval. +. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard. +. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard. The solution must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard must be easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse Github repository.
Workflow
Step1
We need to import the necessary libraries/modules for the code to work. If the libraries already there it is not necessary to install the libraries or other wise user have to install that library by using.

Pip install < library name >
import streamlit as st
import psycopg2
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from streamlit_option_menu import option_menu
Step2
Clone the Phonepe pulse Github repository and extract the data through scripting

Step3
pre-process and clean the data using python and pandas library.

Step4
store the transformed data into a SQL database using the "psycopg2" libaray.

Step5
Use streamlit and plotly libraries in python to create an interactive and visually appealing dasboard

conclusion
our solution leverages Python and its powerful libraries to extract, transform, and analyze data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
By using the "psycopg2" library, we efficiently store and retrieve the transformed data in a MySQL database.
We create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly, allowing users to select different facts and figures to display.
Finally, we ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly by thoroughly testing and deploying the dashboard publicly.
Overall, our solution provides valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository in an accessible and visually appealing manner.
